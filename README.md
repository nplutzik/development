Hello, welcome to SERVEFORCOMMUNITY

Executive Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<b>Problem:<b>

There are so many people in the world who don't have access to affordable healthcare, quality education, or culture/art. Although there are a plethora of community programs available, oftentimes the people who need it the most, fall through the cracks. 


<b>Solution:<b>

Instead of searching through long lists and individual websites, SERVETHECOMMUNITY provides a comprehensive place for people who are seeking community assistance. It also provides opportunities for people who are looking to help their community directly.

Not only can people see what services are available, but they can then research causes that they want to be involved in. This will help with community outreach from both sides.

<br>
<b>Potential Issues:<b>

The digital divide may be an issue. There are many people who do not have access to a computer or a cell phone, and often these will be the same people that need help. This will be a really important challenge to overcome.
